            Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red
            Planet" due to its iron oxide-rich surface, giving it a reddish
            appearance. It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon
            dioxide, with temperatures averaging around -80 degrees Fahrenheit.
            Known for its vast volcanoes, deep canyons, and evidence of ancient
            water flows, Mars is a key focus for exploration. Scientists study
            it for potential signs of past life and future human colonization.
